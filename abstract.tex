\chapter*{Abstract}

Corn planting in the Philippines has been the second most important crop in the Philippines. Researches about agricultural technology have been progressive in improving the quality and production of crops. This research introduces a robot system for corn planting in the Philippines based from an international study on Automated Rice Planting Robot. This research implemented computer vision to its navigation and control mechanisms. With its portability, the study aims to provide a convenient way to plant corn seeds in ideally replacing human labor in corn production. Through modeling the system with RaspberryPi and its camera module, it managed to plant a corn row (as a scaled representation of an actual corn field) with reliable approximations in manual labor. Hence, this robot system managed to perform as expected in terms of applying embedded systems in the field of agriculture; as far as the reach of modern Filipino technology.
